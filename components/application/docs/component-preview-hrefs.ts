/**
 * The entries that have a live preview on the component index.
 *
 * Deliberately a plain module with no `"use client"`: the index page is a
 * server component, and anything it imports from a client module comes back as
 * a client-reference proxy rather than the value. Reading the preview map
 * directly there silently returned `undefined` for every entry, so the page
 * needs a server-safe list to decide which card shape to render.
 *
 * `component-previews.tsx` types its map against this array, so adding a
 * preview without listing it here (or the reverse) is a type error rather than
 * a card that quietly never appears.
